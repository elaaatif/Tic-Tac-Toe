# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using the Tkinter library in Python. The game allows the player to compete against a computer opponent that makes random moves.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/elaaatif/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe
    ```

3. Run the game:

    ```bash
    python XOXO.py
    ```

## How to Play

Upon running the game, a window will appear with a grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board.

1. Choose your symbol by clicking on either "X" or "O" radio button.
2. Click on any empty cell in the grid to make your move.
3. The computer will automatically make its move after yours.
4. The game continues until one player wins, there is a tie, or you choose to reset the game.

## Features

- Player can choose "X" or "O" as their symbol.
- Simple AI opponent that makes random moves.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using Tkinter.
- Reset button to start a new game.

## Code Structure

- `tic_tac_toe.py`: Main script containing the game logic and Tkinter GUI setup.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing instructions and information about the project.

## Enhancements

- **AI Improvement**: Consider implementing a more strategic AI using algorithms like minimax.
- **Code Structure**: Organize the code into functions for better readability and maintainability.
- **GUI Enhancement**: Improve the appearance of the game board and add features like highlighting the winning combination.
- **Error Handling**: Add appropriate error handling for unexpected inputs or actions.
- **User Experience**: Enhance user prompts and messages for a better gaming experience.
